            <p>To soothe my curiosity of which word is
              used most often to describe words in the dictionary, I created a web
              scrapper to scrap dictionary.com to find out for me. It turns out
              that other than words such as 'a', 'in', 'by', 'is', 'the', 'for',
              etc., the most used words for descriptions on dictionary.com as of
              4/15/18 are 'especially' and 'person'.</p>

            <p>This was a fun project for me. For some reason I was curious
              what word is most used to describe other words. It wasnâ€™t
              too hard to get it working. The first time I ran it, however, it
              was painfully slow. Most page requests took about a second,
              but some would take a few more seconds. Across the entire list of
              words, I think I estimated that it would take 10 days total. I
              found that the bottleneck was in the delay in sending and
              receiving the site requests and not in the data transfer. My solution was
              to multithread the program to request multiple pages at once so
              that the bottleneck would be the bandwidth of my internet. With
              this new configuration it took approximately 11 hours.</p>
