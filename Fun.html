          <p>When I was much younger, I learned to cook. I enjoyed cooking and continued to do so. At many gatherings at my house I would be the grill master. In fact, the majority of my family thought I would become a chief, and there were times when I thought I would too, but that was not a career I wanted to pursue. I still enjoy cooking to this day and like trying to make new things. I get told that I am good with picking out which seasonings are needed and building a good flavor profile. </p>
          <p>My favorite thing to make is pizza and pasta. I love pizza, and I decided that I would start making my own fresh pizzas instead of heating up frozen pizzas. I quickly learned how much better fresh pizzas taste and how much better I feel after eating a fresh one when compared to frozen ones. It has been two years since I started making my own pizza, and I have perfected my pizza dough recipe and started making and canning my own pizza sauce. I plan on trying my hand at making pepperoni and mozzarella in the future.</p>

          <h2 class="secondFont">Travel</h2>
          <p>When I was 10ish, I went on a couple trips with my family. The first was a trip to Maui Hawaii where we toured the island, and the second was an RV trip through Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. Both of those trips were fun back then, and I want to go to those places again now that I am older and would appreciate more of it. Those times weren’t the first times that I traveled, because we would travel to see family, but they were the first big trips that I remember. I live close to D.C. and have toured around there a few times. And I have been on a few other trips to the beach during the summer too.</p>
          <p>My most resent trip, and the first big trip that I planned myself, was a weekend trip to Philadelphia with my fiancée. We saw the historic sites, went to the Franklin Institute to see the Terra-cotta Warriors, and ate at the Reading Terminal Market.</p>
          <p>Other than wanting to go back to Hawaii, Arizona, and Utah, I want to travel to Oregon, Washington state, New Zealand, Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and the place I want to visit the most though is Iceland.</p>

          <p>Photography is a hobby that I picked up when I joined a film club
            in school. I ran with it and leaned about composition, color,
            depth of field, and camera function along with getting myself a
            Canon T6i. The thing that I most enjoy photographing is the night
            sky and landscape.</p>
          <p>You can find some of my work on Instagram. My best work is not in
            public on Instagram though. I am still undecided on how worried I
            am about people copying/stealing/using my work. If you have any advice
            about that, I would love to hear it.</p>

          <p>Part of my family are farmers, my immediate family has had gardens and such, and I have worked in a greenhouse one spring, so I have an agriculture streak in me. I decided to try my hand at growing herbs inside so that I have fresh herbs to cook with year-round. I planted basil, thyme, rosemary, and oregano under a grow light. One day I hope to have a decent piece of land to have a nice garden and maybe a couple fruit trees.</p>
