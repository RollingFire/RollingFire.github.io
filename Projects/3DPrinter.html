            <p>I was introduced to 3D printers my first year of college. I took
              a class to learn Solid Works so that I can design things to print
              on it, and for one of my classes, I printed a boat that would
              float. Over the summer after my first year, I bought a kit to
              build my own 3D printer. The kit ended up being a cheap kit from
              China that didn’t come with instructions and gave me a lot of
              problems, and it took a lot of jerry-rigging to get working. I got
              it working though. It still needs some more work to get it more
              accurate and get higher detail, but I haven’t taken the time to
              figure out what needs to be done to it and do it.</p>
