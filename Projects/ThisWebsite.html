            <p>Since most of my programing experience is self-taught, I was
              searching for a good way to market myself, my experience, and
              my skills. A resume fails when it comes to showing what you can
              actually do. Talk is cheap, and actions speak louder than
              words. So, I wanted to find a way to show my work. GitHub is
              a good place to post my work for people to go see, but not a
              good way to draw people to see it. That is where this website
              comes into play. This website fills in where a resume doesn’t
              and is a better way to represent my personality as well as my
              work than what a resume could do.</p>
            <p>When I started this project, I didn’t know HTML or CSS, but
              the most difficult part of this project was coming up with a
              design and layout. I work best when I have a direction or some
              sort of restraint, restriction, or benchmark to achieve. When I
              don’t have those, I tend to create them so that my best work
              comes out.</p>
            <p>To get started on this website, I looked around at other
              people’s personal websites for inspiration. I took the bits
              and pieces that I gathered from others and tried to make it
              my own by infused it with my style and personality. I know there
              are places where the design could be improved, but I am a
              software engineer not a designer. At the end of the day, I am
              happy with the outcome. If I wasn’t happy with it, you wouldn’t
              be seeing it. At times I can be a perfectionist, but I
              understand that there will always be something that could be
              improved. At some point, you must step back and give yourself
              the permission to stop and call it a job well done so that you
              can move on to the next thing.</p>
