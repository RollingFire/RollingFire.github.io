            <p>Sudoku uses numbers 1-9. HexSudoku, on the
              other hand, is hexadecimal based or 0-F. The game will generate new
              puzzles for you to play. This project was written in C++. It is one of
              my first major programs and my first using OpenGL.</p>

            <p>Before this project I questioned the need for in-depth
              planning with diagrams and general definition of functions. As I got
              to the end of the program, it was getting pretty complicated. Luckily
              I had a plan. Instead of getting lost in the mess of functions,
              I could focus on one at a time. This kept me from getting frustrated
              and making mistakes. It allowed me to learn one thing at a time when
              I was teaching myself OpenGL.</p>
            <p>This project was the last project that I did while in school.
              Over winter break and during the first month of classes, I worked
              on and finished the game that you could play through the command
              prompt. I wanted to move the game from the command prompt to an
              actual window with graphics and mouse controls. I thought that one
              of the classes that I was taking that semester would teach me
              that, so I waited for the class to teach it to me. After a month,
              I looked ahead into the class and found out that I wasn’t going
              to be learning it. So, I went and taught myself OpenGL so that I
              could complete this project. Upon completing the project a month
              later, I came to the conclusion that it wasn’t worth the time and
              money that I was putting into school, when I could be learning
              more teaching myself while also learning faster, and getting more
              practical experience.</p>
