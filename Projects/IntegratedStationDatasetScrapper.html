            <p>I was learning about machine learning, and I was looking for a
              project that I could implement machine learning into. I stumbled
              across data.gov and saw that there was new data and nearly real
              time tracking of the US energy production and consumption rates
              and came up with the idea of making a modle that would predict
              energy consumption. I was working with the hypothesis that the
              greatest variance in energy consumption between days would be
              heating or AC usages. That is determined mainly by the temperature
              that day. I decided to use the weather as my first input, see how
              much if any correlation is there, and go from there.</p>
            <p>I found the Integrated Station Dataset, which are logs of weather
              stations that log different weather data. I created these packages
              to download those needed data files, read and save the desired
              data, and also distill the data so that instead of hourly data, it
              will give you daily or monthly data condensed by using whatever
              statistical function you give it.</p>
            <p>After getting this package finished, I went to start creating the
              package to get the energy data which I would use to train the
              machine learning algorithm. I then realized that the energy data
              is tracked in almost real time, but it is only archived monthly.
              Or at least monthly was all that I could find archived for
              download. Monthly data wouldn’t be as useful as daily, and it also
              wouldn’t give me enough data to train the algorithm. So I decided
              that I would cancel the larger project, but put the scraper for
              the Integrated Station Dataset up in my portfolio.</p>
